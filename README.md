## 3. FAQ


1. How can I get my masternode rewards transfered to other address?
   - Enable coin control feature in your wallet (Settings => Options => Display => Display coin control feature)
   - Go to send tab
   - Press the button `Open Coin Control`
   - Select from the input list button only the inputs with amounts different of MN collateral (10000.00)
   - Click OK
   - You can send selected amount to any valid EVOS address.
   - Note: DO NOT EVER Transfer EVOS from that original 10K deposit or you'll break your Masternode.

2. What is the password for the EVOS account on VPS?
   - There is no default password. When you create a user it does not have a password.

3. I get the following error: "Could not allocate vin".
   - Make sure your wallet fully synced and UNLOCKED.

4. How many masternodes can I run using one IP/server?
   - The limit is only the memory. One masternode requires 150-300MB RAM. A server with 1GB memory can run 3 masternodes. Each EVOS MN requires own public IP, so you will need additional IP address(es) to run multiple EVOS MNs on same server.

5. I got stuck. Can you help me?
   - Try to get help from the community and remember to get help only in public channels. Look for our moderators first!
